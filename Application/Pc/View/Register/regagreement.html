You understand that you are not entitled to take delivery and are not entitled to ownership of any underlying instrument. CFDs and other derivatives are not traded on a regulated exchange and are not cleared on a central clearinghouse. This exchange and clearinghouse rules and protections do not apply. The Company reserves the right to, at its sole discretion and for all CFD products, impose the following expiration times: daily/weekly/monthly and/or no expiration at all.-->

Clients may choose to opt out from the features offered by Protected CFDs by choosing the option to use the balance in their trading account in order to keep a CFD position open (“CFDs on margin”). In this instance, when the loss for a position reaches 95%, an additional 20% of the original investment amount is reserved from the Client’s account. If the CFD position takes further losses, the Client’s available balance is further reduced by 20% accordingly. The Client can limit the additional funds reserved on his account balance by specifying his acceptable level of loss for a CFD position. In both features of CFDs described above, the Company offers negative account balance protection i.e. the Client’s losses may never exceed the total amount of funds available in the Client’s account. In addition, the risk of loss in relation to the corresponding potential benefits for CFDs described above, is reasonably understandable in light of the particular nature of the proposed financial contract.-->
